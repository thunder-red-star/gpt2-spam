# dabestpigmaster bookstore story
            DaBestPigMaster walked up behind Bookstore, sword in hand.
            "Bookstore, " DaBestPigMaster stated, "if you don't undeclare war with us, we will have to demolish your base."
           "Bookstore, there is no reason for you to undeclare war, even if you have every right to do so. Since you were attempting to steal our plans, and tried to attack me, we can't just give you a free pass."
          "Bookstore, I will not give you a free pass." Bookstore turned to the other customers. "All of you, there's a mission for you to complete. Do not fight your fellow merchant, but do what you have to do."
              "Oh? What a nice day to do business. I'll see you tomorrow." The customer walked away and disappeared.
                As the guard asked, "Are you just going to leave the merchant here alone?"
               "Well, as much as I hate to admit it, I can't leave this place alone." The guard held his head as he asked, "What's wrong with you?"
               "I'm so scared." The guard said, "I've never seen anyone like this before, even though you are the most dangerous man I've ever met. I won't let you kill me."
               "I'm not afraid, I'm just scared."
              "I'm a businessman, I know that killing me won't change anything. You won't live, but if I'm not mistaken, you'll be dead."
              "So you are a general. What is it that you fear?" The guard asked.
             "I'm afraid of people like you, who have no fear. You just do whatever you want, and you don't mind dying. You don't care what happens to you. I will never allow you to try to kill me."
              "Then why are you here?"
            "To talk to you about your concerns."
           "You mean you don't want to fight me?" The guard asked.
           "No, I just want to talk."
           "Oh? What kind of talk do you want to have?"
            "Well, you see, I have concerns about the business."
           "I don't want to fight you."
          "You know that I cannot harm you. I'm just here to tell you about the business."
         "You have my word, that I will not hurt you."
         "So you're saying that you will not kill me?"
        "Yes, I will not kill you."
         "Are you mad? Why don't you just kill me?" The guard asked.
         "I'm not the one who's mad. You don't know what it means to be a general. I can't just murder you and go home."
        "I'm sorry, but you are wrong." The guard said.
         "How dare you insult my wife!" The guard shouted at him.
        "And what did you do that for? Why, to insult my wife, of course."
        "And what did you do to insult my wife?"
       "You insulted my wife. That's right. I insulted her. That's what I did to you. I mocked her. I insulted her. I insulted her."
       "So you're going to tell me to apologize?" The guard asked.
      "I am going to apologize. I apologize for the
