Stuyvesant High School administrators discovered an illegal cuddle puddle of freshies and sophomores on the fourth floor of the ten-story building.

According to a post on the school's Facebook page, this was the third time this year that cuddling had been prohibited in the building.

"Cuddling is a really great way for students to meet each other and to stay in touch with each other," the post read. "It's great for students to see their friends having a good time. While we strive to make this a safe space, we can't take it for granted."

Administrators sent out a memo to students informing them that cuddling was not permitted.

"I don't want to use the word cuddly because it seems to be taken out of context," said senior Calvin Craig. "But we do hug a lot, and I do like to see my friends do that."

Craig said he and his friends usually have cuddles before their field trip to the zoo, and that he didn't believe that he was the only one to have done so during school hours.

"I can't understand how that would be illegal, but I'm glad my friends are safe," he said.

The post went on to say that all students are allowed to cuddle and hug each other, even if the one doing the hugging doesn't know that they are doing so.

Students in the building say that while cuddling is legal, it's not exactly their thing.

"I think it's cool that they're trying to make it as safe as possible, but it definitely comes across as a little bit cold," senior Adriana Samayoa said. "Cuddling is an actual hug and not just a hug that comes with other things."

"I do like to cuddle with my friends and see them have a good time," senior Biola Kennedy added. "But that doesn't mean I have to cuddle with someone who doesn't know it."

Stuyvesant High School is currently on summer break.

Stuyvesant High School administrators discovered an illegal cuddle puddle of freshies and sophomores on the fourth floor of the ten-story building.

Upon inspecting the building, according to the New York Post, the district found the makeshift stasis chamber filled with twosomes, and that students were cuddling on the floors of their rooms.

District administrators decided to close the school down and cuddle on the hallway floors instead.

The school's principal, James Moore, said it was just a temporary solution, as no classrooms were being used, and that the school administration had never even considered the idea of a cuddle puddle.

"We were really just trying to give our students some space and time to think about the weekend," he said. "That way they're not making that big a deal of it."

"The last thing we want is a meltdown. We want them to have a good time," Moore added.

The school was still temporarily closed, but due to no longer being in use, the fourth-floor cuddle puddle is now all but useless.

According to an incident report, students found the cuddle puddle after students were being evacuated from the school.

"During the evacuation, I saw what looked like a puddle of this fresh milk and sugar on the ground," the report reads. "I called the nurse to come over and check it out. When she came over, she found it was a cuddle puddle. I told her to keep the door closed, and she said she could make it disappear if I would get out of the room."

After exiting the room, students said that the school was much quieter than usual.

"It's not like there was just a whole lot of noise," a student told the New York Post. "I think it helped us have some quiet."
