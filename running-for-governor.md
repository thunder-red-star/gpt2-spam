# running for governor
Furious Gov. Bobby Jindal is turning his sights on a former state senator and anti-abortion crusader who's hoping to run for U.S. Senate.

Ahead of the state's April 20 primary, Jindal, a former U.S. congressman and governor, has launched a campaign to oust Republican incumbent Mary Landrieu of New Orleans and get the GOP's nomination for governor.

Landrieu has been re-elected to a third term in a landslide, but in recent days Jindal has been escalating his attacks, particularly against Landrieu's record on abortion.

"I'm going to get rid of Mary Landrieu," Jindal said in an interview with the Associated Press on Thursday. "And I'm going to fight for every last vote that Mary Landrieu gets."

Landrieu, a staunch supporter of the Affordable Care Act and the Affordable Care Act, has spoken frequently about the Republican strategy to defund Planned Parenthood, even as she has supported federal funding for the group. Landrieu's record has earned her the nickname "Big Mary," and Republican rivals have dubbed her a "war on women" and "war on women."

But Jindal says he's "opposed to every woman's right to choose," and he's been speaking with pro-life organizations about a possible run for the Senate. He said he'll seek only the support of Republicans, saying he wants to compete in the same political environment as his preferred Republican candidates for governor and U.S. Senate.

Landrieu spokeswoman Lauren Passalacqua did not respond to a request for comment. Jindal campaign spokesman Ryan Bird said the governor will release his full campaign platform and answer questions in the coming days.

Landrieu, a former federal prosecutor, says she's running for president "because I'm not going to be silenced by politicians."

Landrieu recently endorsed Jindal, who went after her more than once during the governor's 2014 re-election campaign, but the two never met face-to-face. She's also been critical of his record on abortion, but she hasn't said explicitly she's running against him.

Jindal, who is also considering a 2016 presidential run, said he's been impressed with the work of former Louisiana Secretary of State John Bel Edwards, who backed him in 2010. Edwards has endorsed Landrieu.

"There's been a lot of talk about a Steve Beshear or a Mitch Daniels or a Mike Foster type of guy," Jindal said. "I'm willing to do it all, all over the map. If they're able to find someone who can pull it off, we'll do that."

Landrieu herself has been hesitant about entering the race. "I have my eye on the Senate, but I don't want to be in a primary," she told the New Orleans Times-Picayune in November.

As a state senator, Landrieu voted against two federal bills that sought to require a woman to undergo an ultrasound before an abortion.

She also voted for the so-called "heartbeat bill," which would ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy.

Jindal hasn't been shy about bashing Landrieu on abortion issues, accusing her of wanting to close down the state's only abortion clinic.

"The only people who get abortions in Louisiana are poor women," Jindal said in December 2014. "No one should be forced to choose between making a living and being a mother."
