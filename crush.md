__I have a crush on you.__" He looks at me and my girlfriend and says, "I want to get a new girlfriend."

I say, "You're so over the top. I have a boyfriend and we're going to have a kid." He's shocked and I think he's going to say, "I'm sorry. That's just not how it works." And he says, "I love you."

Toward the end of the interview, they're both about halfway through talking and my girlfriend, who's listening, asks me, "Is it something you're thinking about?"

I don't answer.

But it's the first thing I think about.

I said, "I'm sorry. That's just not how it works."

My partner, who has a child, is mad at me for not telling him I was thinking about him and he said, "I'm not mad at you, I'm mad at the interviewers. They've been lying to us."

They were basically trying to manipulate me into agreeing to be their girlfriend.

They said they had this idea that I'd be willing to meet their needs.

The last thing I said was, "I'm not interested in being someone's girlfriend." I didn't want to fall into their trap. It's all well and good to be a friend, but you should never sell your soul to someone who wants to control you.

I think most people's best idea is to put their guard up and say, "We're not interested in that. I'm not going to be their girlfriend."

I just knew I wasn't going to do it.

Sometimes, you just have to say no and move on.

I'm so grateful to God that I didn't do it.

I think I'm not the most interested person in the world.

And the point is: You shouldn't.
