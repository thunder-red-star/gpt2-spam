# iced tea banned
The principal of Stuyvesant High School, Seung Yu, has told parents in an email that iced tea is not allowed on the school premises and that those who drink it must bring their own containers.

"As for the above-mentioned beverages, if you are unable to bring your own, please bring your own containers," Yu said in the email, which was obtained by The Post. "We ask that you be considerate and do not over-indulge in your students' drinks."

The email also warned that alcohol on school premises is prohibited.

It is unclear whether the school's drink ban is enforced in other New York City schools.

One parent, who wished to remain anonymous, said she and her son attended a school in Brooklyn in 2012, and that the principal said that drinks were allowed on the premises.

"I didn't want to bring my kids to school with me so I couldn't have my son in a school that wouldn't allow him to have an alcoholic beverage on school premises," she said.

The parent said that she found out about the school's drink ban after reading the email, and that she and her son were immediately taken to the principal's office and told that they couldn't have their drinks.

"They said that it was because of my son's age, but I asked them to explain why it was that I couldn't bring my own," the parent said. "The principal said that they had already tried to contact the city's alcohol policies and they said that they didn't have any rules on school property, but I can't just go to the principal and ask for a policy change."

The parent also said that she and her son were banned from bringing their own containers, which she was told was because the school wouldn't let them bring their own liquor.

"I'm not trying to say that this is the only reason that a school is enforcing this policy. But I can't just bring my own container for my son and my son can't bring his own container for his parents," she said.

She added that the principal told her that they were not allowed to bring their own beverages to school, which she said she found unacceptable.

"I'm definitely not going to bring my own cup of tea to school and I'm sure my son is not either," she said.

"I'm not sure why they are banning the beverages," she said. "I think it's a waste of resources."

The parent also said that the principal did not allow her son to bring his own beverage, and that she was told that she could not bring her own cups of water because she didn't have a water dispenser.

"I have a water bottle and a glass of water, and I just can't bring my own water because I don't have a water dispenser," she said.

The parent said that she was told that her son could bring a bottle of soda, but that she couldn't bring her own.

"He told me that I could bring a bottle of soda, but that I couldn't bring my own bottle of soda because I didn't have a bottle of soda dispenser," she said.

"They didn't tell me that I could bring a bottle of soda, but they were telling me that they couldn't bring me my own bottle of soda because they didn't have a water dispenser," she said.

The parent added that she has seen other parents in similar situations with the same principal.

The principal, who is not a school employee, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Post.
