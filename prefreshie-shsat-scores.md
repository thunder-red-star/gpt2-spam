Today, thousands of students in New York City learned about their SHSAT test results. The New York Times interviewed some prefreshies.  If we did not have the 80 or so people who took the test on a daily basis, that would have been devastating to the truth-telling. It would have been like an invasion of the quiet, sometimes hidden world of students and teachers. It would have been the opposite of what happened. The message we were trying to get across, the message we wanted to tell people, was that the school was doing everything in its power to boost test scores. It was through the use of computer systems, with little oversight, that you could literally grade an entire class of 20 and have a statistically significant result. Teachers were actively doing this. And they were being rewarded for it. If you could prove that your test scores were tied to the quality of your teachers, you could get a raise or a bonus. But it was so much more than that. We did not use any magic pills. We used what we call the "herd-intro test." That is the term for what we were trying to do. This was a two-step process. First, you would take a group of 80 students. A few weeks later, we would do another group of 80 students. You were not allowed to take more than that. This was to test the most efficient methods for doing a student group. The group that would be in the classroom with you and the other students would be used to gauge your teacher's effectiveness. Second, you would take the other 80 students and we would have an evaluation process, which would focus on the strengths and weaknesses of the students. Then you would have an interview. We asked that question of the 80 students: What do you need to do to get better in school? Then we tested them again, and we did the same thing. You had to prove that you did have the knowledge, the abilities, and the love of the subject. That's what the students were saying. So this is a quick overview of what we did. The test was administered every other week. There were 15 to 20 questions per test. The test was sent to our school, and when the teacher returned to the classroom, we would take the test again and again. The test was a weekly event. There was a lot of feedback from teachers. You were expected to score 80. You were expected to be judged by your students, not by the standard of the curriculum. We kept taking the test, and we kept doing it. We kept doing it until we did the exact same test in New York City, and then we would do the same test on the weekend, and then the next weekend, and then the next. We'd do it every week. We took this test about once a month. That's a lot of repetition. I remember one week we did a student group. The next week we did a student group. Then the next week we did a student group, and so on. We took about 700 tests. I remember a day that we did about 100 tests. When you were going to give the test, you had to look in the bag and see if you had the test, and if you had the test, you had to give it. Then you had to take it, and then you were told to write a check to the school for 10 percent of the score. But if you didn't, you would have to tell them that you had gotten the wrong test. Now, you didn't get the right test, but you got a check. That's a little bit of a mouthful. The other students were sometimes very embarrassed to have to do it. It was very professional. It was very professional. It was very serious. That was a really high-pressure situation. The teacher who administered the test was not some average teacher. The teacher was the best. That teacher was the best. And, I mean, it was just such a force of nature, I can't even describe how it was. The teacher would take one test, and we would do the next test, and then the next, and then the next. We could not keep up with it. We had a class of teachers working on our test. And there were two teachers. It was a race. You could not have more than two of us in the room at the same time. And we did not have two computers. There was no network. There was no communication. There was no email. We did not have a phone. There was no fax machine. We had no way to take a test by phone. So there were two teachers who were taking tests, but there were four of them. One was the teacher who was in charge of the test, and there were four of them. The other teacher was the kind of teacher that I would describe as the lowest-paid, oldest, most brutal teacher I have ever seen in my entire career. I mean, I would describe that teacher as a
