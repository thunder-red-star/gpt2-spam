The Bookshelf Co., Inc. was attacked and destroyed by SewerGang, a company owned by the one and only "Crimson Green Pig Master", a known Gak. In response, SewerGang released its TNT into the Bookshelf's green animals. The Bookshelf Company has now become a ghost town and has ceased to exist. The Bookshelf is now referred to as a "pirate bookshop" as people have been unable to locate its owner or any of its businesses.
A previously unknown bookseller named "Blueskin", now an "unknown bookseller" on the Internet, was thought to be responsible for Bookshelf Industries' destruction. However, it is reported that someone is now advertising a book by another unknown author on the Internet.
The book is about a woman who finds love with her father's favorite dog, a man who's mother is a famous scientist, and a black dog who has superpowers. It is believed to be a super secret love story that has never been told before. It has been described as a love story between a man and a dog, a love story between a man and a scientist, and a love story between a man and a black dog.

According to Bookshelf Inc., "I'm sorry, I'll have to stop selling your stuff, so please don't call me anymore. I'll leave a message for you. Goodbye!"
At approximately 2:00 pm, SewerGang was on the scene and a fire broke out. In the confusion, a Bookshelf Inc. employee,  Xo Jung-fang (Korean name: 제동연), was allegedly "faking" a phone call to dispatch her company to the scene. When SewerGang arrived at the scene, they found the Bookshelf engulfed in flames and the bookcase destroyed. The Fire Department was unable to extinguish the fire, as the Bookshelf had already fallen into the river, as there was no way to raise it.

However, when he arrived at the scene, he was shocked to find that the Bookshelf was no longer there. It was claimed that he was apparently "tricked" by SewerGang to keep the Bookshelf so that he could then sell it to someone else. It is reported that an unidentified person said that "the owner of the Bookshelf" had lost his mind after seeing SewerGang destroying the Bookshelf.
