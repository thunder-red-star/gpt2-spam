The Bookshelf Co., Inc. was attacked and destroyed by SewerGang, a company owned by the one and only "Crimson Green Pig Master", a known Gak. In response, SewerGang released its TNT into the Bookshelf's green animals. The Bookshelf Company has now become a ghost town and has ceased to exist. The Bookshelf is now referred to as a "pirate bookshop" as people have been unable to locate its owner or any of its businesses.
A previously unknown bookseller named "Blueskin", now an "unknown bookseller" on the Internet, was thought to be responsible for Bookshelf Industries' destruction. However, it is reported that someone is now advertising a book by another unknown author on the Internet.
The book is about a woman who finds love with her father's favorite dog, a man who's mother is a famous scientist, and a black dog who has superpowers. It is believed to be a super secret love story that has never been told before. It has been described as a love story between a man and a dog, a love story between a man and a scientist, and a love story between a man and a black dog.
A CRAZY EXPLOSION IN BOOKSHELF INC.

Date: Incheon, South Korea
Off I-85, Exit 48 South
Incheon Station, Incheon District, City
Suh-ngung/Ring-chung, Jong-sang-gu, South Chungcheong Province, South Korea
According to Bookshelf Inc., "I'm sorry, I'll have to stop selling your stuff, so please don't call me anymore. I'll leave a message for you. Goodbye!"
At approximately 2:00 pm, SewerGang was on the scene and a fire broke out. In the confusion, a Bookshelf Inc. employee,  Xo Jung-fang (Korean name: 제동연), was allegedly "faking" a phone call to dispatch her company to the scene. When SewerGang arrived at the scene, they found the Bookshelf engulfed in flames and the bookcase destroyed. The Fire Department was unable to extinguish the fire, as the Bookshelf had already fallen into the river, as there was no way to raise it.
Uncovering the Owner of the Bookshelf
April 26, 2006
Date: Incheon, South Korea
From 9:30 am to 4:30 pm, a SewerGang leader, Seung-hee "Chin" Mun, was sent to the Bookshelf's offices to retrieve the Bookshelf owner. However, when he arrived at the scene, he was shocked to find that the Bookshelf was no longer there. It was claimed that he was apparently "tricked" by SewerGang to keep the Bookshelf so that he could then sell it to someone else. It is reported that an unidentified person said that "the owner of the Bookshelf" had lost his mind after seeing SewerGang destroying the Bookshelf.
If you see any suspicious incidents, please contact any local police department immediately. This is a very dangerous situation for people to be in, so please report any suspicious events to the police.
"My book was stolen by SewerGang!"
After they discovered the Bookshelf was gone, SewerGang is believed to have "filled" the Bookshelf with TNT. A book by "Kimbabang", who is known to be on SewerGang's payroll, was also stolen.
SewerGang is still at large and no one knows if they will go back to this madness or not.
3. BREAKING NEWS: Bookshelf Industries, the company owned by Bookstore, was bombed and destroyed by leaders of a rival company, Sewergang. It is reported that DaBestPigMaster or Karmapunk, two executives in SewerGang, put TNT into green animals named Creepers and forced them to explode on Bookshelf Industries' property. Bookstore stated that he was "upset that SewerGang took such actions against his company" and  "wanted to take this matter to court". Another security guard, Victor Santos, is said to be a member of the SewerGang, but it is unknown if this is true. DaBestPigMaster, a former member of the SewerGang, has been involved in the decision making of the online booksellers since 2010.
Liam Hutchinson, a security guard at Bookstore, is among the alleged victims of the bombing.
4. BREAKING NEWS: Bookshelf Industries, the company owned by Bookstore, was bombed and destroyed by leaders of a rival company, Sewergang. It is reported that DaBestPigMaster or Karmapunk, two executives in SewerGang, put TNT into green animals named Creepers and forced them to explode on Bookshelf Industries' property. Bookstore stated that he was "upset that SewerGang took such actions against his company" and  "asked if it could be possible for SewerGang to cease its offensive operations and leave the community." SewerGang responded by detonating and destroying the Bookshelf Industries' building, killing seven and wounding fifty, and subsequently their leader, the third-in-command, Jafair, who was in charge of managing SewerGang's operations.
This event seemed to indicate that DaBestPigMaster had lost all hope of a final battle with SewerGang, which may be a more accurate assessment. There have been several occasions in which DaBestPigMaster, in the guise of a Headmaster, attempted to goad SewerGang into a final battle, but he was never successful. DaBestPigMaster was also reported to have been involved in the bombings of Greenbox and Bookstore, so it seems that he did try to goad SewerGang into battle.
Bookshelf Industries's destruction occurred in a forest just west of Bandle City, and the discovery of their fate led to the infamous Goblin Wars . After the war, Bookshelf Industries was officially moved to another location in the outskirts of Bandle City, in the village of Backus.
It has been over five years since the destruction of Bookshelf Industries. It is unknown what happened to the company's employees after the events that transpired, but it is known that it has been operating at a loss, and no progress has been made on any planned projects.

According to Bookshelf Industries, they will stand trial on the charges against them and SewerGang will stand trial on the charges against it. After the trial ends, the company will be forced to seek another buyer. The SFC will be the main bidder to buy the company from Bookshelf Industries. The sale price will be $130 million, $11 million more than the last contract. This is the highest contract to buy a building.
The plans to purchase the Bookshelf building are here . They're completely identical to the plans for the construction of the Delta Hotel, and a subsidiary of Rivergate Property Management has been involved in the plans, both private and public.
