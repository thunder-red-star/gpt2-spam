The Bookshelf Co., Inc. was attacked and destroyed by SewerGang, a company owned by the one and only "Crimson Green Pig Master", a known Gak. In response, SewerGang released its TNT into the Bookshelf's green animals. The Bookshelf Company has now become a ghost town and has ceased to exist. The Bookshelf is now referred to as a "pirate bookshop" as people have been unable to locate its owner or any of its businesses.
A previously unknown bookseller named "Blueskin", now an "unknown bookseller" on the Internet, was thought to be responsible for Bookshelf Industries' destruction. However, it is reported that someone is now advertising a book by another unknown author on the Internet.
The book is about a woman who finds love with her father's favorite dog, a man who's mother is a famous scientist, and a black dog who has superpowers. It is believed to be a super secret love story that has never been told before. It has been described as a love story between a man and a dog, a love story between a man and a scientist, and a love story between a man and a black dog.

According to Bookshelf Inc., "I'm sorry, I'll have to stop selling your stuff, so please don't call me anymore. I'll leave a message for you. Goodbye!"
At approximately 2:00 pm, SewerGang was on the scene and a fire broke out. In the confusion, a Bookshelf Inc. employee,  Xo Jung-fang (Korean name: 제동연), was allegedly "faking" a phone call to dispatch her company to the scene. When SewerGang arrived at the scene, they found the Bookshelf engulfed in flames and the bookcase destroyed. The Fire Department was unable to extinguish the fire, as the Bookshelf had already fallen into the river, as there was no way to raise it.
Uncovering the Owner of the Bookshelf
April 26, 2006
Date: Incheon, South Korea
From 9:30 am to 4:30 pm, a SewerGang leader, Seung-hee "Chin" Mun, was sent to the Bookshelf's offices to retrieve the Bookshelf owner. However, when he arrived at the scene, he was shocked to find that the Bookshelf was no longer there. It was claimed that he was apparently "tricked" by SewerGang to keep the Bookshelf so that he could then sell it to someone else. It is reported that an unidentified person said that "the owner of the Bookshelf" had lost his mind after seeing SewerGang destroying the Bookshelf.
If you see any suspicious incidents, please contact any local police department immediately. This is a very dangerous situation for people to be in, so please report any suspicious events to the police.
"My book was stolen by SewerGang!"
After they discovered the Bookshelf was gone, SewerGang is believed to have "filled" the Bookshelf with TNT. A book by "Kimbabang", who is known to be on SewerGang's payroll, was also stolen.
SewerGang is still at large and no one knows if they will go back to this madness or not.
3. BREAKING NEWS: Bookshelf Industries, the company owned by Bookstore, was bombed and destroyed by leaders of a rival company, Sewergang. It is reported that DaBestPigMaster or Karmapunk, two executives in SewerGang, put TNT into green animals named Creepers and forced them to explode on Bookshelf Industries' property. Bookstore stated that he was "upset that SewerGang took such actions against his company" and  "wanted to take this matter to court". Another security guard, Victor Santos, is said to be a member of the SewerGang, but it is unknown if this is true. DaBestPigMaster, a former member of the SewerGang, has been involved in the decision making of the online booksellers since 2010.
Liam Hutchinson, a security guard at Bookstore, is among the alleged victims of the bombing.

It is reported that DaBestPigMaster or Karmapunk, two executives in SewerGang, put TNT into green animals named Creepers and forced them to explode on Bookshelf Industries' property. Bookstore stated that he was "upset that SewerGang took such actions against his company" and  "asked if it could be possible for SewerGang to cease its offensive operations and leave the community." SewerGang responded by detonating and destroying the Bookshelf Industries' building, killing seven and wounding fifty, and subsequently their leader, the third-in-command, Jafair, who was in charge of managing SewerGang's operations.
This event seemed to indicate that DaBestPigMaster had lost all hope of a final battle with SewerGang, which may be a more accurate assessment. There have been several occasions in which DaBestPigMaster, in the guise of a Headmaster, attempted to goad SewerGang into a final battle, but he was never successful. DaBestPigMaster was also reported to have been involved in the bombings of Greenbox and Bookstore, so it seems that he did try to goad SewerGang into battle.
Bookshelf Industries's destruction occurred in a forest just west of Bandle City, and the discovery of their fate led to the infamous Goblin Wars . After the war, Bookshelf Industries was officially moved to another location in the outskirts of Bandle City, in the village of Backus.
It has been over five years since the destruction of Bookshelf Industries. It is unknown what happened to the company's employees after the events that transpired, but it is known that it has been operating at a loss, and no progress has been made on any planned projects.

According to Bookshelf Industries, they will stand trial on the charges against them and SewerGang will stand trial on the charges against it. After the trial ends, the company will be forced to seek another buyer. The SFC will be the main bidder to buy the company from Bookshelf Industries. The sale price will be $130 million, $11 million more than the last contract. This is the highest contract to buy a building.
The plans to purchase the Bookshelf building are here . They're completely identical to the plans for the construction of the Delta Hotel, and a subsidiary of Rivergate Property Management has been involved in the plans, both private and public.

It is reported that DaBestPigMaster or Karmapunk, two executives in SewerGang, put TNT into green animals named Creepers and forced them to explode on Bookshelf Industries' property. Bookstore stated that he was "upset that SewerGang took such actions against his company" and ~~is implied to have been deeply affected~~ by the deaths of his two workers.
When the humans arrived on the scene, one of them attempted to flee, but was captured and executed by members of SewerGang. The humans were instructed to plant explosives on the building and eliminate any witnesses, and to prevent the building from falling into the fire.
The blast demolished most of the roof, and the remnants of the structure remained standing, now heavily damaged. The structures' upper floors and middle floors sustained damage, and the lower floors collapsed under the force of the explosion. The building is said to be "moving fast." Bookstore and his employees were transported to hospital, where they remain, along with the victims of SewerGang's bomb.
9. BREAKING NEWS: Bookshelf Industries, the company owned by Bookstore, was bombed and destroyed by leaders of a rival company, Sewergang. It is reported that DaBestPigMaster or Karmapunk, two executives in SewerGang, put TNT into green animals named Creepers and forced them to explode on Bookshelf Industries' property. Bookstore stated that he was "upset that SewerGang took such actions against his company" and  "I don't like what's going on." Bookstore stated that he got in touch with his wife and brother-in-law after the incident and that both were "very upset about what happened." It has been reported that it was the same group that burned down Bookshelf Industries' building in 2012. This incident was covered by the internet because a lawyer of SewerGang claims that DaBestPigMaster and his team of SewerGang agents are in fact the same. Mr. DaBestPigMaster is quoted as saying that "We just wanted to kill Bookshelf." You can visit their website here . DaBestPigMaster has stated that he is not affiliated with SewerGang but is working on a project with SewerGang. He claims to be "comfortable with what happened," and as for his involvement with Bookstore, "I can't say I've been involved in it." Bookstore also stated that "there's nothing to me that makes me want to be associated with SewerGang." He further stated that "I can't explain the motive behind it. I have no knowledge of what happened." On the internet, some claim that the tunnel was discovered by SewerGang. However, it has been reported that the tunnel is just a trap set by a rival SewerGang leader, Mr. Karmapunk. Mr. Karmapunk seems to be able to use the SewerGang leader to accomplish his goals because Mr. Karmapunk seems to be a trainee for SewerGang. You can visit their website here . His online name is Sohshoo, and it has been reported that he is the group leader of SewerGang, and that he is in fact the former "King of the Woods". Mr. Karmapunk is also known to have a previous relationship with Yoo Seung-Sun, who is a vocalist of Bookstore, and has been known to "talk shit" to her, but she has also stated that Mr. Karmapunk is just a bully, and has no relation to the SewerGang leader. You can visit their website here . At first, it was reported that the tunnels were actually for a marriage proposal. However, it has been reported that Mr. Karmapunk and Bookstore "just wanted to kill each other." In the same article, Karmapunk states that he is "worried about how the SewerGang may hurt his business and may ruin his reputation." Mr. Karmapunk states that he is not affiliated with SewerGang but has connections with them because he is a trainee. You can visit their website here . Mr. Karmapunk's profile also has a photo of him in a hat with the image of a dog in the background, and a photo of him holding a bottle of booze. His profile also has a picture of a turtle with the image of a cat in the background, and a picture of a turtle holding a beer in the background. Mr. Karmapunk's page on the SewerGang website claims that he is a trainee of SewerGang. You can visit his profile here .
I guess there is still hope that SewerGang can be stopped, I'm sure they have found some way to stop me. I hope they can be stopped.
I'm still feeling the way I did in 2012, I'm so happy. I can't believe I'm back, I thought I was dead. All the hatred and suffering I went through was worth it, now I'm back, there is no worse feeling.
I have the ability to kill more, and now I feel like I can kill even more.
I just can't believe that I'm alive again.
"I'm a free man!"
In an interview with Star Magazine, Mr. Yoo Seung-Sun stated that "It's been over a year since SewerGang first started fighting, but I've kept doing my own thing. I don't think SewerGang will let go of me. I'm still worried about their actions." You can visit his website here .
In the interview, Mr. Yoo also stated that he was "optimistic about the future" of SewerGang. You can visit his website here .
In a January 2016 interview with Naver Matome, Mr. SewerGang stated that they "won't
10. BREAKING NEWS: Bookshelf Industries, the company owned by Bookstore, was bombed and destroyed by leaders of a rival company, Sewergang. It is reported that DaBestPigMaster or Karmapunk, two executives in SewerGang, put TNT into green animals named Creepers and forced them to explode on Bookshelf Industries' property. Bookstore stated that he was "upset that SewerGang took such actions against his company" and  "I suspect that SewerGang was behind this bombing of Bookshelf Industries' warehouse" (Source: https://twitter.com/D.G.I.C/status/774418918774949104). He continued to state "I suspect that SewerGang was behind this bombing of Bookshelf Industries' warehouse." When a member of SewerGang asked why Bookshelf Industries was "a small business" (the company was around 500,000 in revenue and one in four employees were full-time employees), D.G.I.C. stated "Bookshelf Industries had a warehouse with 25,000 books and an engine with 30,000 horsepower and was a very small business in comparison to SewerGang, who had a warehouse with 1.2 million books and a four-ton engine." 
Who Bombed Bookshelf?
SewerGang was founded in 2001 by DaBestPigMaster and Karmapunk, two men associated with a rival company, SewerGang.  They were both arrested on charges of smuggling contraband in 2005, but later released.  DaBestPigMaster was also accused of using his relative's charity to collect large sums of cash, a practice that both SewerGang and DaBestPigMaster have been accused of.   DaBestPigMaster has always denied involvement with SewerGang and has tried to sell the charges as "personal vendetta" and "attempted extortion".  He has also claimed that "SewerGang was an evil organization" that "had me in its crosshairs".  The author of this article, however, believes that DaBestPigMaster was behind the Bookshelf bombing.  He mentions a number of meetings he had with the men, including a meeting where they discussed bombing Bookshelf Industries and "attempting to have the headquarters bombed" (Source: http://rabbithead.blogspot.com/2015/09/bookstore-bombing.html).  His article also describes the effect that Bookshelf Industries had on him and his family:  
"What I'll never understand is why these guys who I thought were my friends and neighbors, were so hostile and hateful towards me."  
\- Deword Eberhard, Bookshelf Industries' former employee  
"Everything that I have and love about the world is gone."  
\- Joseph Bowyer, Bookshelf Industries' former employee  
"I don't know why we have to take the risks with our lives to protect the businesses that we support."  
\- Amanda Gloster, Bookshelf Industries' former employee  
"For us it's about making sure the business doesn't get hurt."  
\- Dan Datsenko, Bookshelf Industries' former employee  
"The only reason we are here is because we love it so much. If we weren't here, we wouldn't be at the table."  
\- Elizabeth Alvarez, Bookshelf Industries' former employee  
"These are bad, bad people. They took the lives of the people who love the business of Bookshelf and it's very hard for me to even begin to tell you what this was about and why. The bookstore was our life and we are in so much pain and heartbreak."  
\- Vickie Smith, Bookshelf Industries' former employee  
"It was obvious the Bookshelf employees were not only at risk, but their families as well. ... I suspect that they knew the likelihood that their families would be hurt in this incident was extremely high. I suspect that they knew that these innocent families were caught in the middle of this act."  
\- Dan Alvarez  
"They had been personally watching this," he said, "and they knew that the destruction of the books would have a devastating effect on their entire business."  
\- Michael Edmonds, Bookshelf Industries' former employee  
"They felt that because they were involved in this enterprise, that their personal careers and families would be damaged, and that they had to do something. It's not that hard for them to understand. They feel that they have a moral obligation to do something."  
\- Greg Johnson, Bookshelf Industries' former employee  
11. BREAKING NEWS: Bookshelf Industries, the company owned by Bookstore, was bombed and destroyed by leaders of a rival company, Sewergang. It is reported that DaBestPigMaster or Karmapunk, two executives in SewerGang, put TNT into green animals named Creepers and forced them to explode on Bookshelf Industries' property. Bookstore stated that he was "upset that SewerGang took such actions against his company" and  "felt a great disturbance in the force." It is also reported that Bookshelf has not been able to purchase any goods from the town due to the murders. Bookshelf Industries, which is based in Pennsauken, NJ, was founded in 2003 by Bookstore. He began his career in the fashion industry. In the video game "The Last of Us", Bookstore is seen wearing a blue jacket with a black jacket. According to the book, Bookstore "convenes and lays plans for each of his characters in order to take them to the most profitable location." His favorite game of all time is "Tom Clancy's The Division." His goal in life is to become a billionaire and acquire the secrets of the world's greatest secret weapons. He has fought the battle of the good guys, and lost. He also has a large collection of weapons.
The book also claims that Bookstore created a special book "Secrets of the Company" which contains information about "the most important secrets of SewerGang". "You need to know about the opportunity of SewerGang, and their position in the industry." Bookstore felt betrayed after their loss in the SewerGang fire and has been trying to get the information out of the company.
Shots Fired.
The book claims that SewerGang's new leader, SewerpigMaster, "comes with a lot of experience and you can count on his skill with a gun." The book further claims that SewerpigMaster was looking for a new leader to take control of the SewerGang business and they were both interested in doing it. After being hired, Bookstore and SewerpigMaster were sent to South African to take part in a training course. After completing it, they were assigned to South Africa to "coordinate the control of SewerGang's supplies." They are described as having a "cold and calculating nature." The book describes SewerpigMaster as "a person of great experience and practicality" and "the only true leader in SewerGang." The book further claims that SewerpigMaster is "a perfect candidate" for a leader of SewerGang. 
In the video game, it is stated that "SewerGang's plans for the future are the same as those of the world's great corporations. They should be in control of the nation's resources, economic growth and the rest of the world."
The book says that if SewerGang is to be eliminated from the game, it will be due to the fact that "the company is at risk of becoming totally dominated by powerful individuals."
It is also stated that in order to find the new SewerGang leader, the group will have to head to South Africa to train. The only way to find out who it is that is calling the shots is through the game. "From there, the group must continue their investigation, travel to the states, and then get in touch with the former leader and take him out."
The book further states that "SewerGang is so powerful that even the President of South Africa, Jacob Zuma, has been forced to work for the company for the past three years."
Some of the aspects of the book:
The only true leader in SewerGang. 
Loses to Bookstore. 
No chance of winning the game. 
A member of the SewerGang is involved in the group.
Bookstore has no idea about the reason why his group is involved.
The book details an event that happened at Bookstore's house. "The FIB informed him that they had been infiltrated by the bodega gang and were not to be trusted. That night, two thugs with AK-47s burst into the house. One of the men, carrying a wooden cross, was the leader of SewerGang. He had the gun, the stetson, and the bodyguard. He threatened to blow up Bookstore's house and burn the entire place down." 
Bookstore is also reported to be a member of the group. The book states that "He called his brother and told him to carry on with his plan. He made it to the gate to the US and headed to New York." "He turned the corner and he had to go to the bathroom. A short while later, he received a call from the women who worked in his store: 'I have some news for

It is reported that DaBestPigMaster or Karmapunk, two executives in SewerGang, put TNT into green animals named Creepers and forced them to explode on Bookshelf Industries' property.

That evening, the city of Regina announced that the police had arrested a suspect. A photo of the suspect was posted on the Regina Police Facebook page as well. They did not release the suspect's name, but they did indicate that they were calling this a "criminal incident". The suspect was charged with arson, and possession of an explosive device, and the owner of the vehicle was released without charges.
4.07PM: The title of this article states that "SewerGang's mother and some employees were forced to leave their home in New York due to threats and harassment by SewerGang members. The owner of Bookstore Industries, Ka-Pong, had to move his family from their home." This is untrue, as we have already pointed out that their home was not occupied, and Ka-Pong did not move his family from his home.
5.48PM: We have been informed that the Police did not have an arrest yet, but that they were currently investigating the incident.
5.52PM: The Regina Police and SewerGang have released an official statement. It does not mention the allegations made by Bookshelf Industries.

6.23PM: The Regina Police's own Facebook page also has a post on the subject. There are a couple of mentions of Karmapunk, but they don't make any mention of any connection with SewerGang.

7.10PM: The Regina Police have told us that they are in the process of collecting evidence from the scene. It is unclear if the Regina Police will be releasing the video or not, as they have not yet.
9.05PM: The Regina Police have released a statement in regards to the claim made by Bookshelf Industries that SewerGang was "intimidated" by SewerGang to dump the TNT on their home. This is false as we have pointed out above.
9.14PM: It is still unclear what the charge against Ka-Pong will be. We are still waiting to hear what details the Regina Police have.
9.32PM: We have been informed that SewerGang has not yet been arrested. We have not heard anything from them about why.
9.43PM: A comment from Ka-Pong's Facebook page has caused the Regina Police to not release any details regarding the incident.
