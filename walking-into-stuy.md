# walking into stuy
You enter Stuyvesant High School with your backpack on your back and your ID in hand.   You walk up the steps to the front of the school and you're immediately confronted by two security guards.   I'm not sure if they see you because you have a backpack or they see you as an observer.   One of them asks you what you're doing and you respond that you're going to the gym and you're going to go into the locker room to change.   He tells you to get out of there.   You are then asked to put your backpack down.

# walking into stuy, generation 2
You enter Stuyvesant High School with your backpack on your back and your ID in hand.   Once you're in, you walk to the front of the building and start to speak with the bus driver.  He asks you to take a seat, which you do.  You then go through a security check and get your bags.  You then walk to your seat, which is your designated seat.  Once you're in your seat, you begin to fill out your registration form.  You can't write down your name on the form because that would give you away.  You can write down your date of birth and zip code.  You can also write down your name, gender, and ethnicity.  Your name is not listed on the form because you'll be the only one there and you'll have to leave your ID and ID card at home.  You'll also have to write down your address.  You can't write down anything else on the form.  When you're done, you'll enter your name and address into the computer, which will give you a receipt.  You'll then be able to walk up to the front desk to pay for your bus fare.  When you get on the bus, you will be given a receipt, and your bus ticket will be placed on your backpack.  You'll also be given a sign that says "Riders of this bus have been required to submit to a government-mandated fingerprint search."  It's important to note that this doesn't actually happen until you get off the bus.  You'll be asked to hand over your ID card.  If you don't, you'll be asked to go back to the security check point and put your ID card back on your backpack.  If you do, you'll be taken to the front desk and told to show your ID card.
