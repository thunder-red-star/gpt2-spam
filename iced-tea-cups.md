# iced tea cups
Stuyvesant High School security guards found iced tea cups, pencils and loose change in the bathrooms at the school on Monday, October 24, 2017.


NYPD detectives are now investigating the incident as a possible hate crime.


The incident happened in the men's restroom of the school.

In a letter to parents, Superintendent Thomas T. DiNapoli said the school is taking the incident seriously, and that the school is conducting a thorough investigation.


"I want to be very clear that we are taking this incident very seriously, and I want to assure you that the safety and security of our students, faculty, staff and visitors is our top priority," DiNapoli said.

According to a police report, the iced tea cups were found in the men's restroom of the school.


"I can't tell you how many times I had to close the door for a minute, just because I didn't want to get any ideas about the people who might be there," said student Paulino Gonzales.

Students said they were horrified to find the cups, saying they were filled with empty water bottles.

"I'm pretty sure I have some of the same people in my classes. I just don't want them to be involved in something like this," said student Josh Ponce.

The school said it's looking into the incident.

"We are taking this situation very seriously, and we will not tolerate any form of hate or intolerance. We will make sure our school is safe for our students, staff, and visitors," DiNapoli said.
