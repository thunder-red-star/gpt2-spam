# becoming a freshman
The principal of Stuyvesant High School, Seung Yu, is pleased to announce that 김수공, a Japanese student, is a junior and plans to become a freshman this fall.

The school is proud of him. "He is a superb student. We have all tried to raise him. He is so polite and bright. He is also very good at sports," said the principal.

Jin-Soo Kim, a sports science major, said, "He has a very strong sense of responsibility. His self-confidence is also high. He has the right attitude to make it to the next level."

Since he was born in Korea, he is Korean by birth. His parents are Japanese, and his grandparents are also Japanese.

He likes his school and his classmates. "I hope I can do well here," he said.

This is not the first time that a Korean student has been a freshman. In 1995, the school's first Korean student, Yoo-Jung Kim, was a freshman.

School officials said that this was the first time a Korean student received the honor. "We congratulate him. We hope he can continue to become a high school student," said Jeon-Yoo Lee, director of the school's sports center.

The school's record of receiving the honor of freshman is three times the national average.

The school will hold a celebration to mark the accomplishment.

"I hope this will encourage other Korean students to study abroad," said the principal.

Other schools in Korea that have received the honor are Seongnam University, South Korean University of Science and Technology, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
